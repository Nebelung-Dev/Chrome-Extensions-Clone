# Chrome Extensions Clone
Clone of the chrome://extensions page with Material You. This is just for fun!

Yeah it's all my code.

Things not added:
- Anything working
- Search
- Effect on click on search or button
- Toggle hover effect (it looks bad imo)
- Search get small when screen is smaller

Light mode is included in the code but not used.
